# esuc-eweek-2020
This web page is based on https://github.com/CodyHouse/schedule-template.

So far, we have to work on:
1. Update the format
   - Work on css file. Might need to add more class or id tags in index.html
   - Change the color of the event
   - Change the format of the form
2. Add week-long event
3. Make the pop-up window contain content
   - Work on .js file
4. Fix the issue that when hovering on the event, the event becomes traparent
5. Write the introduction of each event
   - write all events' .html files
   - add link to FB event page
